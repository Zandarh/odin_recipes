        <h2>The Nigerian Egg Roll</h2>
    <p>The Nigerian Egg roll is entirely different from the famous Chinese Egg Roll. In Africa, we prepare our version of Egg Roll just as the name implies. It is a boiled egg wrapped in a mass of dough and deep-fried.</p>
    <p>This Egg roll is often sold as street food in west Africa. However, Tea lovers can have this for breakfast. Also, you can serve it with a glass of cold juice for brunch; For me, I eat this any time of the day and I must add, it is a very filling snack.</p>
    <p>Just like the Scotch Egg, the African Egg roll is deep-fried and also very easy to make. However, a key to achieving great success in making this recipe lies in the preparation of the dough; the dough will be a little wet and soft and a bit hard to work with, donâ€™t be too concerned about that at this stage.  </p>
