            <p>Jollof Rice: I can’t think of a more popular West African dish than Jollof rice. It’s popular for good reason — it is delicious!</p>
            <p>There are hundreds of different dishes in the world, but there is only a handful that has enough flavor for me to eat alone. A bowl of Jollof rice is one of those dishes. You know, the kind where you can taste the spoon or fork after you’re done with the food? I mean, you’d want to lick it clean. Jollof is deliciously addictive.</p>
            <p>Jollof rice is a staple in West African cuisine. It’s made from rice, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and other seasonings. The dish is cooked in one pot. It’s simple and easy to make at home—and the end result is absolutely delicious!</p>
            <p>This recipe for jollof rice can be customized in many ways to suit your tastes and preferences, you could add any of your favorite vegetables (diced carrots, green beans, sweet peas, or sweet corn). It can be enjoyed with chicken, beef, lamb meat, goat meat, or fish. I love pairing mine with some fried Plantains, coleslaw, and baked chicken!

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>sauteeing the Onions. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger and garlic and cook along with the tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the time this is ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer, you might risk burning them.</li>
            <li>Add the blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. I often stop when the sauce becomes really thick, and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce.</li>
            <li>add the thyme, curry powder, salt, white pepper (good but optional), and seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to.</li>
            <li>stir in the Rice. Make sure you stir the rice properly until you cover each grain of rice with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Now add the chicken stock.</li>
            <li>Once the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook until the rice is done, about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish, or Gizzards and plantains.</li>
        </ol>
